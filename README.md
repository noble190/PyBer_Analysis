# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis has been to study ride sharing data from a number of municipalities split into three categories: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Through the use of DataFrames and visualizations, we are able to examine the patterns in the data as they manifest across the municipality types.

## Results

With Pandas, we were able to use groupby together with aggregate functions to summarize the ride sharing data:
